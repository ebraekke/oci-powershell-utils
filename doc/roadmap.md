# Outline of future plans and ideas

Last updated: 24-feb-2023

Short term:
* Delete ephemeral keys in cmdlet before handing control back.
* Add `Invoke_Ssh*` script variant that pulls key (= secret) from the OCI Vault.  
* Clean up documentation. 
* Add disclaimers. 

Medium term: 
* Add proper versioning and metadata to module ? (not sure if needed when "published" as docker image) 

Longer term: 
* Add examples for Liquibase. 
* Package scripts in a Docker container.
* Integrate Docker container in a DevOps pipeline.
